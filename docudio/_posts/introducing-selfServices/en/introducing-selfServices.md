# selfServices by Docudio
selfServices is a concept, that many in the industry have adopted, but that we are especially passionate about. selfService is a way of life for us at Docudio, we don't enjoy roadblocks, and it reflects in how we do business, and want to share our experiences through this platform.

## What will selfService do?
selfServices will host a blog, podcasts, youtube tutorials, and courses, on how people can apply complex concepts to make the coordination of infrastructure teams with development teams easier. We often will apply the concepts we discuss in selfService, to Docudio. Thus we are tied together!


## What's Next ? 
selfServices website will be coming online, and making their first post. https://selfservices.dev will host all this content, and also be available at https://selfservices.docudio.com. We will maintain separate social media accounts, so people can get separate updates and information about things we are doing in selfServices!
