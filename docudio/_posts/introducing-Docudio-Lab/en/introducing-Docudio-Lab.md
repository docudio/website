# Docudio Lab
our Lab is a innovation space, that many in the industry have adopted, but that we are especially passionate about. Innovation is a way of life for us at Docudio, we don't enjoy roadblocks, and it reflects in how we do business, and want to share our experiences through this platform.

## What will Docudio Lab do?
It will host a blog, podcasts, youtube tutorials, and courses, on how people can apply complex concepts to make the coordination of infrastructure teams with development teams easier. We often will apply the concepts we discuss in our Lab, to Docudio. Thus we are tied together!


## What's Next ? 
Our Lab website will be coming online, and making their first post. https://lab.docudio.com will host all this content. We will maintain separate social media accounts, so people can get separate updates and information about things we are doing in our Lab!
