Hello! Welcome to the Docudio Blog, if you are reading this, this is our FIRST EVER blog post, and we want to welcome you. Let us quickly show you some of the things we want to discuss here in the future, the current state of the business, and our future plans.

# What will we post here? 
Docudio is a product that we are actively developing and seeking help for. If you are interested in working on an open source project, with opportunities to grow into a full time position, email us at docudio@gmail.com. 

Since Docudio is a product, this blog will often post about the product, and the new things we are doing with it! Since the goal is also to turn Docudio into a business around the product, we will also post on our business, and what we are doing. 

# Current State of Docudio
We are in the early startup phases. We have a very small team right now, but a lot of energy to make Documentation easy. Myself, I have had a very hard time in my corporate job with Documentation, which is why this idea was born! So if we are successful, you can bet I'll be using this product myself!. 

We could use your help! Docudio can be a place for all IT System Documentation to live and be useful, I believe Documentation can actually be beneficial to our lives, and not a burdensome task. 

# Future Plans
Lookout for this website to continue being filled out. We are very young right now, and looking for help! Want to contribute on code for this website or our product? Go visit https://github.com/docudio and get involved! Or email us at docudio@gmail.com
